# Functional Component Contact List
Let's create a contact list using functional components and mapping.
Here is what the finished application will look like:

So let's break this down:

You have a list of contacts that has to be  put into /src/data/contact.json
You need to bring this data into your App.js
You will have to create a new component to hold each individual contact ( hint you probably want to use Map here)
At the very least for styling your app should be in a list of contacts down the center of the page with the photo in a circle on the left and the information on the right
Bonus!!! If you want to go above and beyond create the layout shown in the GIF on this page that looks like a phone screen and only shows a few contacts at a time
Ultra Bonus!!! Recreate the mockup shown below in React and have the contacts render on the screen!
Have Fun!!!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
